## Count Pairs Whose Sum is Less than Target

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n and an integer target, return the number of pairs (i, j) where 0 <= i < j < n and nums[i] + nums[j] < target.
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,1,2,3,1], target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 pairs of indices that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
- (0, 1) since 0 < 1 and nums[0] + nums[1] = 0 < target
- (0, 2) since 0 < 2 and nums[0] + nums[2] = 1 < target 
- (0, 4) since 0 < 4 and nums[0] + nums[4] = 0 < target
Note that (0, 3) is not counted since nums[0] + nums[3] is not strictly less than the target.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-6,2,5,-2,-7,-1,3], target = -2
Output: 10
Explanation: There are 10 pairs of indices that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
- (0, 1) since 0 < 1 and nums[0] + nums[1] = -4 < target
- (0, 3) since 0 < 3 and nums[0] + nums[3] = -8 < target
- (0, 4) since 0 < 4 and nums[0] + nums[4] = -13 < target
- (0, 5) since 0 < 5 and nums[0] + nums[5] = -7 < target
- (0, 6) since 0 < 6 and nums[0] + nums[6] = -3 < target
- (1, 4) since 1 < 4 and nums[1] + nums[4] = -5 < target
- (3, 4) since 3 < 4 and nums[3] + nums[4] = -9 < target
- (3, 5) since 3 < 5 and nums[3] + nums[5] = -3 < target
- (4, 5) since 4 < 5 and nums[4] + nums[5] = -8 < target
- (4, 6) since 4 < 6 and nums[4] + nums[6] = -4 < target
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length == n <= 50
-50 <= nums[i], target <= 50
## Make String a Subsequence Using Cyclic Increments

You are given two 0-indexed strings str1 and str2.

In an operation, you select a set of indices in str1, and for each index i in the set, increment str1[i] to the next character cyclically. That is 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', and so on, and 'z' becomes 'a'.

Return true if it is possible to make str2 a subsequence of str1 by performing the operation at most once, and false otherwise.

Note: A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: str1 = "abc", str2 = "ad"
Output: true
Explanation: Select index 2 in str1.
Increment str1[2] to become 'd'. 
Hence, str1 becomes "abd" and str2 is now a subsequence. Therefore, true is returned.
Example 2:

Input: str1 = "zc", str2 = "ad"
Output: true
Explanation: Select indices 0 and 1 in str1. 
Increment str1[0] to become 'a'. 
Increment str1[1] to become 'd'. 
Hence, str1 becomes "ad" and str2 is now a subsequence. Therefore, true is returned.
Example 3:

Input: str1 = "ab", str2 = "d"
Output: false
Explanation: In this example, it can be shown that it is impossible to make str2 a subsequence of str1 using the operation at most once. 
Therefore, false is returned.
 

Constraints:

1 <= str1.length <= 105
1 <= str2.length <= 105
str1 and str2 consist of only lowercase English letters.
## Sorting Three Groups

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.

The numbers from 0 to n - 1 are divided into three groups numbered from 1 to 3, where number i belongs to group nums[i]. Notice that some groups may be empty.

You are allowed to perform this operation any number of times:

Pick number x and change its group. More formally, change nums[x] to any number from 1 to 3.
A new array res is constructed using the following procedure:

Sort the numbers in each group independently.
Append the elements of groups 1, 2, and 3 to res in this order.
Array nums is called a beautiful array if the constructed array res is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Return the minimum number of operations to make nums a beautiful array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,1,3,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: It's optimal to perform three operations:
1. change nums[0] to 1.
2. change nums[2] to 1.
3. change nums[3] to 1.
After performing the operations and sorting the numbers in each group, group 1 becomes equal to [0,1,2,3,4] and group 2 and group 3 become empty. Hence, res is equal to [0,1,2,3,4] which is sorted in non-decreasing order.
It can be proven that there is no valid sequence of less than three operations.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,2,1,3,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: It's optimal to perform two operations:
1. change nums[1] to 1.
2. change nums[2] to 1.
After performing the operations and sorting the numbers in each group, group 1 becomes equal to [0,1,2,3], group 2 becomes empty, and group 3 becomes equal to [4,5]. Hence, res is equal to [0,1,2,3,4,5] which is sorted in non-decreasing order.
It can be proven that there is no valid sequence of less than two operations.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,3,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: It's optimal to not perform operations.
After sorting the numbers in each group, group 1 becomes empty, group 2 becomes equal to [0,1,2,3] and group 3 becomes equal to [4,5]. Hence, res is equal to [0,1,2,3,4,5] which is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 3
## Number of Beautiful Integers in the Range

You are given positive integers low, high, and k.

A number is beautiful if it meets both of the following conditions:

The count of even digits in the number is equal to the count of odd digits.
The number is divisible by k.
Return the number of beautiful integers in the range [low, high].

 

Example 1:

Input: low = 10, high = 20, k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 beautiful integers in the given range: [12,18]. 
- 12 is beautiful because it contains 1 odd digit and 1 even digit, and is divisible by k = 3.
- 18 is beautiful because it contains 1 odd digit and 1 even digit, and is divisible by k = 3.
Additionally we can see that:
- 16 is not beautiful because it is not divisible by k = 3.
- 15 is not beautiful because it does not contain equal counts even and odd digits.
It can be shown that there are only 2 beautiful integers in the given range.
Example 2:

Input: low = 1, high = 10, k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: There is 1 beautiful integer in the given range: [10].
- 10 is beautiful because it contains 1 odd digit and 1 even digit, and is divisible by k = 1.
It can be shown that there is only 1 beautiful integer in the given range.
Example 3:

Input: low = 5, high = 5, k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: There are 0 beautiful integers in the given range.
- 5 is not beautiful because it is not divisible by k = 2 and it does not contain equal even and odd digits.
 

Constraints:

0 < low <= high <= 109
0 < k <= 20
